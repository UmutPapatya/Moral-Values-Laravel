                                Sonu is a darling boy. He loves to read books and play with his favorite toys. He is the dearest son to his mom and he loves his mother a lot. He is a gentle and obedient child. But the only problem with Sonu is he doesn't like food. Whatever food is offered to him, he eats very little and throws the rest.<br>
                                Day by Day, Sonu's mother got very tense about his eating habits. She discussed this problem with her friend. Her friend suggested teaching him the importance of food. Sonu's mother thought it was a very good idea.<br>

                                The very next day, Sonu's mother asked him to take a fistful of rice and pour it into a pot and then go for dinner. He did it as his mother said and went for dinner. This repeated every day and soon, daily it became a regular habit for Sonu to pour a fistful of rice in the pot before dinner.<br>
                                After a month of regular pouring, the pot became full of rice. The mother decided to cook vegetable rice and asked Sonu to help him prepare the food. Sonu and his mother happily prepared food while Sonu also learned how to cook food. After that, they both set forth to a street with food, where there are poor kids. <br>

                                Sonu's mother asked Sonu to offer food to the kids. The kids felt very happy and ate completely as it was very delicious. Sonu felt very happy watching this and got tears in his eyes.<br>

                                After returning home, Sonu said, " Mother, now I got to know the value of food. The food we waste is very precious for the one who does not have it. Now I'll never throw food and will never hurt you. Also, I got to know the importance of offering food to others and the happiness in it ". By listening to these words, the mother felt very happy and hugged her Son. She happily thanked her dear friend for this suggestion in her mind.<br>

While they were walking they got into an ugly argument and out of anger one of them slapped the other on the face. The one who was slapped, though was hurt he did not said anything and quietly wrote over the sand "I am hurt because today my friend hit me on my face". They resumed walking and kept walking until they came across an oasis. They decided to take bath in the oasis then. While they were taking bath the one who had got slapped started drowning. The other friend came to his rescue and saved him. After he got rescued, he wrote on the stone "Today I was saved by my best friend".

                                The other friend asked him, "Why did you write on the sand when I slapped you while you wrote on the stone when I saved you?" Upon this, the other friend replied that its better we write on sand when your friend hurts you as it will be gone with the wind but write it on stone when your friend does something good to you so that it could be engraved forever.
