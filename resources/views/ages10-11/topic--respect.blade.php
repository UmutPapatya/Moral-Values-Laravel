                                            Once upon a time, an old man spread rumors that his neighbor was a thief. As a result, the young man was arrested. Days later the young man was proven innocent. After being released, the man felt humiliated as he walked to his home. He sued the old man for wrongly Accusing him.

In court, the old man told the Judge, “They were just comments, didn’t Harm anyone..” The judge, before passing sentence on the case, told the old man, “Write All the things you said about him on a piece of paper. Cut them up and On the way home, throw the pieces of paper out. Tomorrow, come back to Hear the sentence”.

The next day, the judge told the old man, “Before receiving the Sentence, you will have to go out and gather all the pieces of paper That you threw out yesterday”. The old man said, “I can’t do that! The wind must have spreads them and I won’t Know where to find them”.

The judge then replied, “The same way, simple comments may destroy the honor of a man to such an extent that one is not able to fix it. The old man realized his mistake and asked for forgiveness”.

                                            Once upon a time, there was a small town. There lived a man by himself who couldn’t see. He was blind. Yet, he carried a lighted lamp with him whenever he went out at night.

One night as he was coming home after having a dinner outside, he came across a group of young travellers. They saw that he was blind, yet carrying a lighted lamp. They started passing comments on him and made a fun of him. One of them asked him, “Hey Man! You are blind and can’t see anything! Why do you carry the lamp then?!”

The blind man replied, “Yes, unfortunately, I am blind and I can’t see anything but a lighted lamp which I am carrying is for the people like you who can see. You may not see the blind man coming and end up pushing me. That is why I carry a lighted lamp”.

The group of travellers felt ashamed and apologized for their behaviour.
